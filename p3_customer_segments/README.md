# Project 3: Creating Customer Segments

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for
some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a
cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing did not
discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper
option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting
complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling
deliveries â€” losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. 

The purpose of this project is to find what types of customers
they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the
future. This is to be done using unsupervised learning techniques to see if any
similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into
distinct categories.
